                <h2>Is There Something You Already Love Doing?</h2>
                <p>Do you have a hobby or something you loved doing as a child, but never considered it as a possibility for a job?
                    Whether it’s reading comic books, collecting something, or creating or building, there is probably a way you could do it for a living.
                    Open a comic book shop, or create a comic book site online.
                    If there’s already something you love doing, you’re ahead of the game. Now you just need to research the possibilities of making money
                     from it.</p>

                <h2> Find out What You Spend Hours Reading About</h2>
                <p>For myself, when I get passionate about something, I’ll read about it for hours on end. I’ll buy books and magazines. 
                    I’ll spend days on the Internet finding out more.
                    There may be a few possibilities here for you, and all of them are possible career paths. Don’t close your mind to these topics. 
                    Look into them until you feel your heart is content, and this will help you get started as you learn how to find your passion.</p>

                <h2>Brainstorm</h2>
                <p>If nothing comes to mind right away as you’re asking how to find my passion, get out a sheet of paper and start writing down ideas[1].
                    This doesn’t need to be an organized list. It can simply be a paper full of random notes or even doodles. All of this will eventually 
                    come in handy later.</p>
